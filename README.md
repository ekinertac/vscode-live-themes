Live Theme Previewer is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to preview and apply themes in real-time without installing them. Experience different color schemes instantly and find the perfect theme for your coding environment.

## Features

- Browse and preview a wide range of VS Code themes
- Apply themes temporarily without installation
- Quick and easy theme selection process
- Instant preview of theme changes
- Revert to original theme with a single click

## Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X on macOS)
3. Search for "Live Themes"
4. Click Install

Alternatively, you can install the extension from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EkinErtac.live-themes).

## Usage

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS)
2. Type "Live Themes" and select "Live Themes: Preview Themes"
3. Browse through the list of available themes
4. Select a theme to preview it in real-time
5. Choose a specific theme file if multiple options are available
6. To apply the theme permanently, click on the "Install Extension" button when prompted

## Commands

- `Live Themes: Preview Themes`: Open the theme selection interface

## Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The extension works out of the box.

## Known Issues

- The extension is compatible with the "Settings Sync" feature but it'll change your settings file while your're browsing themes. You're gonna get multiple settings sync notifications.
- If you're using a dark theme, the light themes will look bad on preview. Same applies to dark themes when you're using a light theme.
